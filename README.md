# NeuromodulationWithRL (from pytorch-a2c-ppo-acktr)

## Please use hyper parameters from this readme. With other hyper parameters things might not work (it's RL after all)!

This is a PyTorch implementation of
* Advantage Actor Critic (A2C), a synchronous deterministic version of [A3C](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783v1.pdf)
* Proximal Policy Optimization [PPO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347.pdf)
* Scalable trust-region method for deep reinforcement learning using Kronecker-factored approximation [ACKTR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05144)

## Supported (and tested) environments (via [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com))
* [Atari Learning Environment](https://github.com/mgbellemare/Arcade-Learning-Environment)
* [MuJoCo](http://mujoco.org)
* [PyBullet](http://pybullet.org) (including Racecar, Minitaur and Kuka)
* [DeepMind Control Suite](https://github.com/deepmind/dm_control) (via [dm_control2gym](https://github.com/martinseilair/dm_control2gym))

<!-- I highly recommend PyBullet as a free open source alternative to MuJoCo for continuous control tasks.
 -->
All environments are operated using exactly the same Gym interface. See their documentations for a comprehensive list.

To use the DeepMind Control Suite environments, set the flag `--env-name dm.<domain_name>.<task_name>`, where `domain_name` and `task_name` are the name of a domain (e.g. `hopper`) and a task within that domain (e.g. `stand`) from the DeepMind Control Suite. Refer to their repo and their [tech report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00690) for a full list of available domains and tasks. Other than setting the task, the API for interacting with the environment is exactly the same as for all the Gym environments thanks to [dm_control2gym](https://github.com/martinseilair/dm_control2gym).

## Requirements

* Python 3 (it might work with Python 2, but I didn't test it)
* [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/)
* [Visdom](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom)
* [OpenAI baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines)

In order to install requirements, follow:

```bash
# PyTorch
conda install pytorch torchvision -c soumith

# Baselines for Atari preprocessing
git clone https://github.com/openai/baselines.git
cd baselines
pip install -e .

# Other requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run training
python3.6 -W ignore main.py --env-name "AssaultNoFrameskip-v0" --num-frames  10000  --log-evaluation  --lr 1e-3
